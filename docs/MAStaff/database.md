* Recomendation, if you have a network use MySQL

## MySQL

To use MySQL you need to have a MySQL or MariaDB server running. You can use a local server or a remote server.

1. First go to the config and change the type from SQLite to MySQL
2. Fill the params with your host database data acces, then restart the server
